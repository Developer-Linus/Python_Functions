# Python_Functions
- Functions are reusable piece of code for performing specific tasks. 
- They assist in breaking down complex programs into smaller, manageable parts.

## Function Definition
- To create a function, I use the keyword **def** followed by the name I want to give my function. Then, I put parantheses (if any), followed by a colon. After that, I write the code for what I want my function to do, and i indent this code to show it's part of function. Check the file `function_definition.py` to see how this is done.
