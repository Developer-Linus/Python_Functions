# Python_Functions
- Functions are reusable piece of code for performing specific tasks. 
- They assist in breaking down complex programs into smaller, manageable parts.

## Function Definition
- To create a function, I use the keyword **def** followed by the name I want to give my function. Then, I put parantheses (if any), followed by a colon. After that, I write the code for what I want my function to do, and i indent this code to show it's part of function. Check the file `function_definition.py` to see how this is done.

## Lambda Functions
- Also called **anonymous** functions because they do not need a name.
- used for writing simple, one-line expressions.
- useful when passing a simple function as an argument to another function, as in the `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions.
- Only applicable to one line of code that is simple.
- Also used when you need to define a temporary function without need for defining a full function separately.
- check the file `lambda.py` to see how it is done.
